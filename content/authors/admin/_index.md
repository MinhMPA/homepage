#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Minh

Minh models and analyzes different probes of large-scale structure (LSS) in our Universe to gain insights into gravity, dark energy, dark matter and the formation of LSS. His works connect theories to observations through novel and rigorous statistical inference frameworks. Minh is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Kavli Institute for Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, University of Tokyo.
