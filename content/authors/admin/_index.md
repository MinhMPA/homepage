      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Minh Nguyen is a modeler. MN models and analyzes different probes of large-scale structure (LSS) in our Universe to gain insights into gravity, the dark sector and the formation of LSS. He builds a Field-level Bayesian Inference (FBI) framework that allows for the joint inference of cosmological parameters, the inital conditions of the early universe, and the entire history of LSS formation. MN further develops robust statistical methods for high-dimensional inference problems, within the context of ML and simulation-based inference or MCMC sampling and optimization techniques.  
MN is a Leinweber Postdoctoral Fellow at Leinweber Center for Theoretical Physics, University of Michigan.
